Excited to share my latest DevSecOps project where I deployed a Netflix Clone on the cloud with security and automation at its core! ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¹ Project Flow:
âœ… Security First: Integrated SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check, and Trivy to ensure a secure codebase.
âœ… Automated CI/CD: Used Jenkins to build, test, and deploy seamlessly.
âœ… Containerized & Scalable: Dockerized the app and pushed images to Docker Hub.
âœ… Kubernetes Deployment: Managed deployment with Helm and GitOps using ArgoCD.
âœ… Monitoring & Observability: Leveraged Prometheus & Grafana for real-time insights.

This project showcases how DevSecOps bridges security, automation, and scalability in cloud-native applications. ðŸš€
